San-Francisco Business Inspection: A Use Case of Food inspection
by Scott W. Davis
In this report we will explore and analyze a dataset collected about San-Francisco businesses
inspections. I have applied most of the stages of the data science methodology that I have studied
in this specialization. This project will introduce a business inspection predictive analytics report
that can help promote business safety and for example food business as part of the many processes
put to prevent food-borne illness. Some of these processes include proper handling of food, proper
preparation of food and its storage. Food inspection ensures that all these processes are done in
such as a manner as to promote and achieve food safety.
Food inspection involves not only sampling and testing of end products but also assessing food
centers to ensure compliance with food safety management systems. This minimizes the
occurrence of public health food safety problems. Food inspection dates back to ancient times as
part of the history of public health. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) publishes the Food
Code that sets guidelines and procedures to assist in food control jurisdictions. The Food Code
provides a scientifically and legally backed basis for regulating the retail and food service
industries. These include restaurants, grocery stores and institutional food service providers e.g.
nursing homes. In the past, food inspection was done in a reactive manner whereby officers waited
for reports of joints with possible non-compliance. However, it has been shown through research
that food inspection should be done in a more proactive manner. Currently, some cities in the
united states e.g. San Francisco are implementing a technologically driven approach to food 
inspection to try and predict food establishments that are more likely to be non-compliant to food
safety regulation. This is driven in part by the low Inspector to Food place ratio making it difficult
to efficiently inspect all the food places. We will use Foursquare which comes with venue data that
contains key descriptors of different venues including the category and popularity. This will show
categories such as Nursing homes and food establishments along with attributes like name, address,
ratings, and reviews from millions of points of interest. This report would be beneficial to public
health specialists and every stakeholder working to alleviate public health concerns through
preventive measures. The solution is not to introduce food inspection since these professionals are
already carrying out food inspections in the relevant jurisdictions but to make the process more
efficient.
In San-Francisco, it is estimated that one business inspector needs to efficiently inspect more than
500 business establishments given that there are only about 4 dozen inspectors to cover all business
establishments. It is in waking of this statistic that the city saw an opportunity to make the process
of food inspection more efficient by utilizing data analytics. In San-Francisco, through the
Department of Public Health, systematically collected food inspection data from close to 100,000
sanitation inspections. Using this data, together with metadata on weather, related complaints e.g.
sanitation, business characteristics, the city’s advanced analytics team helped predict the food
establishments that are more likely to violate food safety regulations. The food inspectors can then
have a “Critical first” inspection approach where the places that have been predicted to have critical
violations are inspected first.
Some of the factors that tend to predict critical violation include previous critical violations, high
temperatures, nearby sanitation complains, nearby burglaries etc 
This report would be beneficial to public health specialists and every stakeholder working to
alleviate public health concerns through preventive measures. It is not to introduce food inspection
since these professionals are already carrying out food inspections in the relevant jurisdictions but
to make the process more efficient.
Data Description
In this section I will the data that will be used to analyze the problem of food inspection and the
source of the data. In order to develop a sufficient prediction system, the data should have the
following categories:
• Weather Data- In public health, the weather is a key component. Long rains are associated
with flooding which predisposes to contamination of food with waterborne microbes.
• Crime Data- Higher crime rates have been strongly correlated with poverty due to lack of
employment. Poverty has been in turn correlated with low hygiene which tends to predict
the occurrence of critical violations of food safety regulations.
• Places Data-To help locate food establishments for inspection, there needs to be a way to
pinpoint exactly where they are situated and preferably show it on a map. There are
different sources of places data each which its set of strength and weakness.
• Inspection Data- Inspection data contains information such as previous the history of
critical violations, type of facility, whether the establishment has a tobacco license and the
length of time the establishment has been operating.
• Water and Sanitation data- Garbage and sanitation complaints can be used, together with
other data, to try and predict critical violations. A place with frequent sanitation complaints
is more likely to have a joint with critical violations as compared to another without any
complaint.
• Demographics data- Demographics especially health demographics contain data about
people living around a place including the age, sex, estimated income, occupation, recent
infections all of which can be carefully correlated and used to predict a critical violation.
However, the data I have found is collected from (https://data.sfgov.org/Health-andSocialServices/Restaurant-Scores-LIVES-Standard/pyih-qa8i). The Health Department has
developed an inspection report and scoring system. After conducting an inspection of the facility,
the Health Inspector calculates a score based on the violations observed. Violations can fall into:
• High risk category: records specific violations that directly relate to the transmission of
food borne illnesses, the adulteration of food products and the contamination of
foodcontact surfaces.
• Moderate risk category: records specific violations that are of a moderate risk to the
public health and safety.
• Low risk category: records violations that are low risk or have no immediate risk to the
public health and safety.
The score card that will be issued by the inspector is maintained at the food establishment and
is available to the public in this dataset.
